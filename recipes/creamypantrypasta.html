        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Can't have dairy or think you hate the taste of beans? This luscious sauce is creamy, rich, and the perfect way to add that extra bit of protein to your menu.</p> <br> <p>Made from budget ingredients you can always keep in your pantry, this meal is comforting and delicious</p> 
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><ul><li>1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling</li><li>1 cup walnuts, finely chopped (optional)</li><li>1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li><li>5 garlic cloves, 1 whole, 4 thinly sliced</li><li>2 sprigs rosemary</li><li>2 15.5-oz cans cannellini (white kidney) beans, rinsed</li><li>12 oz paccheri, rigatoni, or other large tubular pasta (the sky is the limit!)</li><li>1 lemon</li><li>2 Tbsp finely chopped parsely</li><li>Kosher Salt</li><li>Freshly ground black pepper</li></ul></p>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p><ol><li>Heat ¼ cup oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add walnuts and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, until nuts are deeply golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and grate in whole garlic clove; set aside.</li><li>Wipe out pot. Combine ¼ cup oil and remaining sliced garlic in pot and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until oil around garlic is bubbling vigorously and garlic is beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Firmly crush rosemary in your hand to bruise; add to pot along with beans and stir to coat. Increase heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are just beginning to take on color, about 3 minutes.</li><li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions.</li><li>When pasta is about 4 minutes away from being done, transfer 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to pot with beans (make sure to keep heat on medium so that the liquid doesn’t evaporate too quickly). Using a wooden spoon, gently mash about three-quarters of beans into a creamy sauce.</li><li>Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer pasta to pot with beans and add 1 cup pasta cooking liquid and 2 Tbsp. oil; mix well to combine. Increase heat to medium-high, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring gently with a heatproof rubber spatula, until sauce coats pasta, about 2 minutes. (Sauce might look soupy but will thicken as it sits so don’t worry!) Finely grate in about one-quarter of zest from lemon, then cut lemon in half. Squeeze in juice from 1 lemon half and add parsley; mix well to combine.</li><li>Divide pasta among bowls. Drizzle with oil, season with black pepper, and top with reserved nut mixture. Slice remaining lemon half into wedges and serve alongside for squeezing over.</li></ol></p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
    <p><ul><li>I've also used Great Northern Beans with great success, and other types too if you don't mind the flavor and color.</li><li> Dry beans can be soaked and cooked to use in place of canned</li></ul></p>
